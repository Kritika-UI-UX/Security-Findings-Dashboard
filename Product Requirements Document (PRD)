# Security Dashboard â€“ UX Internship Challenge

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a UI/UX designer who doesn't have a background in codingâ€”yet!  
But that doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m not eager to learn and grow.

Coming from a design-focused background, Iâ€™ve always worked primarily in Figma for case studies, prototypes, and presentations. Exploring GitHub and working with code for this project was completely new territory for meâ€”but also incredibly rewarding.

Even if I donâ€™t make the cut for the internship, Iâ€™m truly grateful for this opportunity. It pushed me out of my comfort zone and reminded me how important it is to stay curious and always be open to learning new thingsâ€”even when they feel intimidating at first.

## ðŸ›  Workflow Overview

1. **User Research & PRD**  
   I began by understanding the userâ€™s needs, defining key problems, and writing a clear Product Requirements Document.

2. **Figma Design**  
   I designed the full dashboard UI in Figma, focusing on clarity, usability, and actionable UX.

3. **Prompting with Lovable.dev**  
   I used structured prompts with [Lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev) to generate supporting copy and interface components that matched the design intent.

Thank you for reviewing my work!
