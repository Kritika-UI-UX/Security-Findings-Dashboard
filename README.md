# Security-Findings-Dashboard
I''m a UI/UX designer with no coding background, but I’m eager to learn. This project pushed me out of my comfort zone—GitHub and code were new to me. I did user research, wrote a PRD, designed the dashboard in Figma, and used Lovable.dev to refine it. Even if I don’t make the cut, I’m grateful for this opportunity and what I’ve learned
